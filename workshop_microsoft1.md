This 2,5h workshop will cover a set of services to give you the chance to 
get in-depth hands on experience with Microsoft Cognitive Services and how you can enrich your apps with the 
possibilities they offer.  

After each workshop you will have coded a fully functional Android app and used different Cognitive Service APIs.
