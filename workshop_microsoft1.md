#MimicMe (Xamarin.Forms):

This 2,5h workshop will cover a set of services to give you the chance to 
get in-depth hands on experience with Microsoft Cognitive Services and how you can enrich your apps with the 
possibilities they offer. After the workshop you will have coded a fully functional Android app and used different Cognitive Service APIs.

I’ll take you through the creation of a simple party-game called „MimicMe“ using Xamarin.Forms. We make use of the Emotion API and the Camera, so make sure to bring your Android device with you.
