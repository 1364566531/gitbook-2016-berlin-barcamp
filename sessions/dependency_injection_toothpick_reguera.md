# Dependency Injection & Toothpick

During this talk I'll introduce Toothpick, a new dependency injection framework for Java with special focus on Android.
It offers a compromise between complexity and performance, being as simple as Roboguice and almost as fast as Dagger!
By the way, the testing integration is simply awesome!
You will see that a toothpick is sharper than a dagger!
