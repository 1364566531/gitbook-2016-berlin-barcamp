Live Coding

- using android-atp
- Annotation based implementation
- idea: generate the constants: No hard coded Strings in your code
- Code generation for the ceremonial tasks
- Fall back to Android default API is always possible
- don't want name every Row in a Table so we need a portial
- to use portial we need to annotate the code (primary key)

- Questions?: Annotation Process other libraries?
