#Fischers Fritze (native Android)

This 2,5h workshop will cover a set of services to give you the chance to get in-depth hands on experience with Microsoft Cognitive Services and how you can enrich your apps with the possibilities they offer. After the workshop you will have coded a fully functional Android app and used different Cognitive Service APIs.

I’ll take you through the creation of another simple party-game, this time it’s even a native Android app! I’ll show you how to use the Speech Recognition API (and the microphone, obviously), so make sure to bring your Android device!
